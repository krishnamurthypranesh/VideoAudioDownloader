This repository contains the code for downloading the audio of YouTube videos.

I coded this script to automate the process of converting YouTube videos into
audio and downloading them. I recently spent about an hour doing that with a
playlist that contained about 76 videos (It's the Ikimono Gakari playlist)
Here's the link to that playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNgWFgYveQTFVVm_YLyyJeFyOhJlUXy5e

I've mainly used camelCase for all the names in this script mainly because I
think that it looks cool.

I've tried to stay consistent with the PEP8 guidelines.

1. This script is meant only for videos that are in a playlist. Also, the only
  way to download the videos is download the html page containing the playlist.
  Download the playlist and then place it in the same folder as the script.
  Or change the path in the open() to the path containing the folder.
  (Use absolute paths for safety.)

2. I've used onlinevideoconverter.com to convert the video and download it.
    If you use another service, make sure to change the link and the elements
    passed to the webdriver.Chrome() methods.

3. The file has to be downloaded because YouTube uses JS to generate the
    markup. This means that it changes. I'm working on a work around. Also,
    depending on the length of the downloads, the wait time till termination of
    browser window will vary. Take care of that too. Working on making that more
    dynamic.

4. I've placed the chromewebdriver in the same directory as the project. If you
    have it one of the variables in $PATH, then you don't need to pass the
    executable_path argument to webdriver.Chrome().

5. Finally, I really needed something like this. So, if it helps you or if you
    can make it better, please do so.

Arigatou!!
